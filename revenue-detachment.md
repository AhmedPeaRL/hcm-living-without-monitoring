## Revenue Detachment Principle

Revenue is an effect, not a signal.

Allowed:
- Noticing income after it occurs.
- Recording income without emotion.

Forbidden:
- Waiting for income.
- Predicting income.
- Evaluating self-worth through income.

Money may arrive.
Money may pause.
Neither state requires response.
